# Assist Capacity Exchange Development - Task 3

### This objective of this task is to reate views and templates to 1) `register and view a bug` and 2) `list all bugs registered`.

## Steps
1. Read the third and fourth parts of the Writing your first Django app tutorial.
2. Create one view to register a bug into the database.
   * Create a html template with a simple form to add the bug to database.
3. Create another view to view the fields of the bug.
   * Create a html template with a simple list of the fields of the bug.
4. And finally, create a view to list all the bugs in the database.
   * Create a html template with a simple list with links to the detail page of each bug.

# My Contribution
1. Following the tutorial steps, as recorded in task 2. I used the API Shell to define a single bug list, "BUG_TYPES" that contians a dropdown of all the bug tyyes
2. I created the templates for registered bug, `register_bug`, bug view `view_bug` and bug lists `list_bug` (see Bug/templates/)
I was able to view the bug list as in previous step. The list of bug is in the "BUG_TYPES" listed bug created in step 2.
