# CapX_Task1
# Assist Capacity Exchange Development `ID T346641` Details
This is the first task for T346641: , aimed at getting you familiar with the basic structure of the development of the Capacity Exchange platform.

`Objective of the task`: Create a Django project with an app called bug and commit it in GitHub.
Steps:

Create a Django project with an app called bug. We recommend you use PyCharm, but if you are familiar with other IDEs, you are welcomed to use them instead.
Commit your Django project to GitHub and send us a link to your project (by email, on our talk page, or replying to this tickect, as you prefer).

# OBSERVATIONS
1. Most of the tasks were done from the command line, using the guide in the tutorial link of the task page.
2. For python script writing (editing the Python files), such as creating a model call 'Bug', I used VS Code.

4. I created a URL and was able to display my welcome message

5. The app created can be used for `Tracking` , `Project Management` , `Learning` etc.
6. The app appears to bear some similarity with Jira (although Jira runs on JS and not python).
7. I hope I get the chance of being selected for this internship so as to build my use and knowledge of platforms like this.
