# OBSERVATIONS
1. 
2. I could not identify any problem with the error ril
1. The tutorial was a bit confusing from the back and forth edit in the steps, also the since the polls app has more classes than the bug app, some instructions were ambiguous in application to me. However, I was able to successfully create / run the automated 'future_bug' test to view an automated test check.
